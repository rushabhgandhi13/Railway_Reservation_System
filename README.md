# Railway_Reservation_System
Implementation of railway management system using queue data structure with various facilities. Our system is mainly divided into two parts the ADMIN part and the USER part.The admin being in control of the railway reservation system can view and manipulate data according to his needs and can also create notices as per requirements which will then be displayed on the users ticket. Coming to the users part, the users are capable of booking, cancelling and viewing their booked ticket.
